A person casually bought a function online, and during the acceptance test, they told the teaching assistant that it was written using state compression, minimax search+alpha beta pruning+special pruning (in response to a must kill move), A * optimization (heuristic search), iterative deepening search, chess type killing module, chess type mapping table, Zobrist permutation table, and multithreading. The teaching assistant didn't even look at the code and gave it a full score. Although I used a rating sheet to write it, it's not as complicated as him, but it's disgusting to score 85 points higher than me.
